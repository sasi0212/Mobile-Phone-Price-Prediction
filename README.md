# Mobile-Phone-Price-Prediction

India is the second-largest smartphone market in the world, which makes one of the most popular destinations for mobile phone brands. The
objective is to predict the price of the mobile phone for given specifications so that new entrants can develop a pricing strategy to give tough
competition to the already available market players and also to convince customers that they are paying the best price for the given
specifications.

*Data collected by scraping the existing mobile phone models from the website digit.in.
  
*Data cleaning stage involved removing text attached to numerical values, reducing the cardinality available in the categorical columns, and converting numerical values measured in different units to standard units.
  
*Exploratory Data Analysis stage involved identifying missing values and imputing them, identifying outliers and treating them.
  
*Built different models KNN Regressor, SVR, Random Forest Regressor, XGBM Regressor and evaluated each model performance based on the metric RMSE.
