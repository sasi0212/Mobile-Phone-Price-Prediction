# Mobile-Phone-Price-Prediction

India is the second-largest smartphone market in the world, which makes one of the most popular destinations for mobile phone brands. The
objective is to predict the price of the mobile phone for given specifications so that new entrants can develop a pricing strategy to give tough
competition to the already available market players and also to convince customers that they are paying the best price for the given
specifications.
